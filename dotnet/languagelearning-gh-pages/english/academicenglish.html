    <p>This page is about the English skills that non-native speakers need in an academic context,
      especially when writing papers and reports.
      Since there are 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varieties_of_English">many varieties of English</a> (not just 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English">British English</a> and 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English">American English</a>), 
      and most people in Europe learn British English at school,
      the descriptions of the resources below mention which variety of English is used or taught.
    </p>

    <p>Many papers and other academic publications are written by non-native speakers of English.
      This page contains some guidelines to help improve the readability and grammar of these documents. 
    </p>
    <p><strong>A few reminders and notes</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>This page is <strong>work in progress</strong>.</li>
      <li>Most of this page is about British English. If you prefer American or Canadian English, 
        you're on your own (but check out the <a href="#references">references</a> at the end of this page).
      </li>
      <li>Many native speakers may be used to a more informal writing style. This guide, however, is about academic English and therefore assumes a formal writing style.</li>
      <li>Many of the examples below come from deliverables produced in European research &amp; development projects 
        (projects funded by the European Commission and executed by consortia of organisations from all over Europe).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>General Advice</h2>
    <p>One of the sources of difficult prose is the "curse of knowledge": the inability to imagine that the reader does not know what you know. 
      The following tips can help you exorcise the curse of knowledge:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Keep in mind "the reader over your shoulder", <abbr>i.e.</abbr> try to imagine what the intended reader knows or does not know.</li>
      <li>Let a representative reader review a draft of your text. Ideally, this reader is an intelligent person who is <em>not</em> an expert in your field.</li>
      <li>Leave the text alone for a few months before rereading it. This way, you can be a surrogate for the "representative reader".</li>
      <li>Read the text aloud. This will help you detect some verbiage and 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_%28linguistics%29">hedging</a> 
        that looks fine on the screen but does not work when read aloud.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Spelling</h2>
    <h3><abbr>UK</abbr>, <abbr>US</abbr>, Canadian, &hellip; Spelling</h3>
    <h4>General Guidance</h4>
    <p>Choose a spelling convention and stick to it throughout the document. 
      Make sure that the document's <strong>language setting</strong> matches the spelling convention you have chosen. 
      In Microsoft Word you can check the language setting in the status bar below the editing area. 
      You can make sure that the language setting is consistent throughout the document by pressing <kbd>Control+A</kbd> 
      (to select all the content) and selecting the appropriate language under 
      Review > Language > Set Proofing Language&hellip; 
    </p>
    <h4>Examples</h4>
    <h5>-our versus -or</h5>
    <p><abbr>UK</abbr> spelling: (foreground) colour, &hellip;; <abbr>US</abbr> spelling: (foreground) color, &hellip;</p>
    <h5>-er versus -re</h5>
    <p><abbr>UK</abbr> spelling: centre, home theatre, &hellip;; 
      <abbr>US</abbr> spelling: center, home theater, &hellip;
    </p>
    <h5>-ce versus -se</h5>
    <ul>
      <li><abbr>UK</abbr> spelling: a licence, to license (or to licence), practice makes perfect, to practise, &hellip;</li>
      <li><abbr>US</abbr> spelling: a license, to license, practice makes perfect, to practice, &hellip; <!-- @@check --></li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, when citing the title of a specific licence, use the spelling used by that licence, e.g. "the General Public License (GPL), version 3.0". </p>
    <h5>-ise/-yse versus -ize/-yze</h5>
    <ul>
      <li><abbr>UK</abbr> spelling: customise, initialisation, organisation, analyse, &hellip;</li>
      <li><abbr>US</abbr> spelling: customize, initialization, organization, analyze, &hellip;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: many organisations in the <abbr>UK</abbr> use the spelling with '-ize' and '-ization'. 
      This is known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_spelling">Oxford spelling</a> or 
      <abbr>OED</abbr> spelling. However, this does not affect the spelling of <strong>analyse</strong>!
    </p>
    <h5>-ll- versus -l-</h5>
    <ul>
      <li><abbr>UK</abbr> spelling: modelling, modelled, &hellip;</li>
      <li><abbr>US</abbr> spelling: modeling, modeled, &hellip;</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>-e- in ageing, gamification, &hellip;</h5>
    <ul>
      <li><abbr>UK</abbr> spelling: ageing (see <a href="http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/ageing?q=ageing">Cambridge</a> and 
        <a href="http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/ageing?q=ageing">Oxford</a>; 
        <a href="http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/ageing?showCookiePolicy=true">Collins</a> also accepts 'aging'), 
        gamification (without 'e'; <a href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/gamification?q=gamification">Oxford dictionary</a>), &hellip;
      </li>
      <li><abbr>US</abbr> spelling: aging (see <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aging?show=0">aging (see Webster), gamification">Webster</a>), gamification, &hellip;
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Notes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Many -ing forms have been accepted as adjectives and don't have in 'e' in British English, e.g. in "a raging thirst".</li>
      <li>Sometimes, there is a difference in meaning: singing comes form the verb 'to sing', while singeing comes from the verb 
        '<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/singe">to singe</a>' (to burn slightly).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Frequently Misspelled Words</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>screen reader (always written with a space)</li>
      <li>to fulfil (fulfilled); <abbr>US</abbr>: to fulfill</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Capitalisation (Upper Case or Lower Case)</h3>
    <p>The following rules are not exhaustive but should be sufficient for writing papers and other academic publications. 
      <br />Capitalise: 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>names of people, places, organisations, institutions;</li>
      <li>months and days of the week;</li>
      <li>titles of documents (books, deliverables) and journals.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Do not capitalise: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>nouns (<abbr>e.g.</abbr> project, deliverable, report, social network, &hellip;);</li>
      <li>in titles: prepositions (in, at, for) shorter than five letters, and articles (a, an, the), except when they are the first word in a title.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There is no consensus on: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Internet or internet (a place or a technology?);</li>
      <li>the Web &amp; the World Wide Web or the web &amp; the world wide web.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Examples from project deliverables: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>"this Deliverable" -> "this deliverable". The word "deliverable" is not a title but an ordinary noun. </li>
      <li>"&hellip; to access the Social Networks" -> "&hellip; to access (the) social networks"</li>
      <li>"the Remote Control" -> "the remote control"</li>
      <li>"He uses Hotmail for emails, google docs for documents, &hellip;" -> "He uses Hotmail for emails, Google Docs for &hellip;": 
        Hotmail and Google Docs are names.
      </li>
      <li>Examples of unusual capitalisation: TalkBack (Android feature), 
        <a href="http://webinsight.cs.washington.edu/papers/webanywhere-html/">WebAnywhere</a> (web-based screen reader), &hellip;
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Hyphens Versus One Word or Separate Words</h3>
    <p>The hyphen or dash is used: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>in (attributive) adjectives formed from two or more words, 
        <abbr>e.g.</abbr> a well-researched paper, a 30-year-old pilot, 
        but not necessarily in predicative adjectives, 
        <abbr>e.g.</abbr> "this paper is well researched" 
        (see <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/internet-grammar/adjectiv/attribut.htm">Attributive and Predicative Adjectives</a>)
      </li>
      <li>in most words that begin with anti, counter, half, inter, non and semi</li>
      <li>in ex- when it means 'former': ex-wife</li>
      <li> to replace 'and', e.g. "the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator"</li>
      <li>to avoid ambiguity; for example:
        <ul>
          <li>a "heavy metal detector" is a metal detector that weighs a lot or heavy detector made of metal, 
            whereas a "heavy-metal detector" is a detector of 
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_%28chemistry%29">heavy metals</a> 
            (example borrowed from <a href="http://www.grammar-monster.com/lessons/hyphens_in_compound_adjectives.htm">Grammar Monster</a>);</li>
          <li>"re-sign" means to sign again, "resign" means to quit a job or position;</li>
          <li>"re-cover" means to provide with a new cover, "recover" means to get well again.</li>
          <!--purple people eater: eater of purple people or a purple eater of people-->
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>to avoid a confusing sequence of letters, <abbr>e.g.</abbr> "re-enter a password", "pre-echo", "pre-eminent" 
        (but the hyphen is usually not needed in words with pre- followed by a consonant, 
        <abbr>e.g.</abbr> prepaid)
      </li>
      <li>in compound adjectives where the main component consists of more than one word, <abbr>e.g.</abbr>
        &ldquo;non-achievement-oriented students&rdquo; (example from the <a href="http://www.apastyle.org/learn/faqs/when-use-hyphen.aspx"><abbr title="American Psychological Association">APA</abbr> Style Guide</a>);
      </li>
      <li>in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_compound#Using_a_group_of_compound_nouns_containing_the_same_.22head.22">compounds containing the same "head"</a>, 
        <abbr>e.g.</abbr> "cloud- and web-based" (note the "hanging hyphen" after 'cloud')
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is not a full list. 
      <a href="http://www.economist.com/style-guide/hyphens">The Economists' Style Guide</a> 
      gives more rules and examples. When in doubt, consult a dictionary.
    </p>
    <p>Many new terms start out as two words, then become hyphenated, and finally become accepted as a single word. 
      In some cases, there is no consensus whether a term should be written with a hyphen or as one word. 
      <!-- @@outdated; find new example.
      For example, most words starting with "auto" are written as one word, but "autosuggestion" is written without a hyphen in the 
      <a href="http://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/autosuggestion?q=autosuggestion">Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary</a>, the 
      <a href="http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/autosuggestion">Collins English Dictionary</a> and the 
      <a href="http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/autosuggestion?a=british&q=autosuggestion">Cambridge Dictionary Online</a>,
      but was written with a hyphen ("auto-suggestion") in the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary before 2014. 
      -->
    </p>
    <p>Examples from deliverables:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>"low-vision users" (though the phrase "users with low vision" is more correct)</li>
      <li>"a multi-user application"</li>
      <li>"Web-based screen reader" (needs a hyphen because "Web-based" is used as an attribute)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Examples of words written with a hyphen: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>fine-tune</li>
      <li>hands-on demonstration/training/&hellip;</li>
      <li>hearing-impaired (some dictionaries list "hearing impaired" as an alternative)</li>
      <li>real-life scenarios/footage/&hellip;</li>
      <li><a href="http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/real-time?a=british">real-time</a> 
        (as an attribute; derived from the noun "<a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/real+time">real time</a>")

      <li>well-known</li>
      <li>cost-benefit analysis</li>
      <li>a step-by-step approach (because used as an adjective; compare: "we will proceed step by step")</li>

      <li>prepilot (though some spelling correctors prefer "pre-pilot")</li>
      <li>pretest (<a href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/pretest?q=pretest">Oxford</a> and 
        <a href="http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/pretest">Collins</a>; 
        <a href="http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/pretest?q=pretest">Cambridge</a> also accepts pre-test)
      </li>
      <li>shortcut (noun and verb;
        <a href="http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/shortcut?showCookiePolicy=true">Collins</a> 
        used to allow the hyphen in the verb&mdash;short-cut&mdash;but no longer does now)
      </li>
      <li>multimodal</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Examples of words with a space:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>end user (however, when the phrase is used as a modifier, you add a hyphen, <abbr>e.g.</abbr> "end-user experience")</li>
      <li>screen reader</li>
      <li>smart house</li>
      <li>task force</li>
      <li>data type</li>
      <li>value space</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Special cases: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>e-mail / email: There is no consensus on the spelling of "e-mail" or "email", but the spelling without the hyphen tends to be favoured.

        runtime (<a href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/runtime?q=run-time">Oxford</a>). 
        However, when used as an adjective before a noun, the spelling is either run-time or runtime:

    </ul>

    <h2>Punctuation</h2>
    <h3>Comma</h3>
    <p>The comma is used in the following situations:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>To replace "and" or "or" in an enumeration or a similar series of items, <abbr>e.g.</abbr>: 
        <ul>
          <li>"The guidelines do not cover the needs of people with all types, degrees and combinations of disabilities."
          </li>
          <li>"George shot the video, Maria added captions to it and Ignacio uploaded it to the server."
          </li>
          <li><strong>Note</strong>: <strong>American English</strong> places a comma before the final "and". 
            <strong>British English</strong> only places a comma before the final "and" when the penultimate item in the list includes another "and". 
            For example: 
            <ul>
              <li>"He ordered coffee, bacon and eggs, and toast."</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>To combine two sentences into a single one by means of a conjunction such as "but", "yet", "while" or "so": 
        <ul>
          <li>"The first evaluation phase will experience some delay, but this will not affect the next phases."
          </li>
          <li><strong>Note</strong>: If the subject of the second sentence is omitted, or if the conjunction is "and" or "or", the comma is not obligatory. 
            For example:
            <ul>
              <li>"The peer reviewers found the deliverable unsatisfactory(,) but did not give advice on how to improve the document."
              </li>
              <li>"The peer reviewers proposed several changes to improve the deliverable(,) and the authors followed the proposals."
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>After an introductory adverb (<abbr>e.g.</abbr> "nevertheless", "however", "suddenly"), an introductory phrase or a parenthetical phrase:
        <ul>
          <li><q cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_water">Surface and ground water are two separate entities, so they must be regarded as such. 
            <strong>However</strong>, there is an ever-increasing need for management of the two &hellip;</q>
          </li>
          <li>"In Windows, for example, you can choose between different desktop themes." 
            <br /><strong>Note</strong>: "For example" is not always a <em>parenthetical phrase</em>, 
            <abbr>i.e.</abbr> removing the phrase changes the meaning of the sentences or creates a meaningless construction.
            <br />Example: "He sometimes has difficulty reading the screen, <em>for example</em> when his eyes get tired."
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>To delimit a 
        "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_relative_clauses#Restrictive_or_non-restrictive_relative_clauses">non-restrictive relative clause</a>" 
        (a type of clause that you can leave out without changing the meaning of the main clause): 
        <ul>
          <li>"The tests, <em>which will take only half an hour</em>, will take place in the usability lab."
          </li>
          <li>"This document is available under Creative Commons, <em>which is a licence for content, not software</em>."
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>After an introductory phrase: 
        <ul>
          <li>"<em>The son of a shoe maker</em>, he gained a place at King’s School Canterbury from where he won a Parker scholarship to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge." 
            (Introductory appositive phrase;

        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Notes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Note the difference in meaning between, "I saw a film which was very boring" and "I saw a film, which was very boring". 
        The first sentence implies that the film I saw was very boring, while the second implies that watching films was a boring activity. 
        In the first sentence, "which" can be replaced with "that"; this is not possible in the second sentence. 
        In speech, there would be a pause before "which" in the second sentence, but not in the first sentence. 
        Grammatically speaking, the first sentence contains a "restrictive relative clause" (the which clause restrict the meaning of "film" to one particular film), while the second sentence contains a "non-restrictive relative clause" (the which clause just provides some additional information but the main clause does not change in meaning without the which clause).
      </li>
      <li>You do not write a comma to introduce a "restrictive relative clause", 
        <abbr>i.e.</abbr> a clause that is necessary to identify the person or thing you are talking about. 
        <abbr>E.g.</abbr>: 
        <ul>
          <li>The man who can dominate a London dinner-table can dominate the world. (Oscar Wilde)
          </li>
          <li>The man who doesn't read good books has no advantage over the man who can't read them. (Mark Twain)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Incorrect use of the comma can lead to unintended changes in meaning:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><q>Let's learn how to chop, marinate, and cook friends.</q>
        (<cite><a href="https://twitter.com/Grammarly/status/761200068158455810">Grammarly on Twitter</a></cite>)
      </li>
      <li><q>After retiring my wife, my parents, the kids, and I plan to travel around the country.</q>

    </ul>

    <h3>Semicolon</h3>
    <p>Outside <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#Programming">programming</a>, 
      the semicolon is mainly used in two situations. 
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>To join two complete sentences without a connecting word such as <em>and</em> or <em>but</em> 
        and when the colon is not a valid alternative. Example: 
        <ul>
          <li>Some matchmakers are already implemented and integrated into the Cloud4all Personalisation framework; 
            other matchmakers will be implemented in the next project years. 
            (Quoted from Cloud4all deliverable D204.1.)<!-- @@add link -->
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>To separate items in a list that already contain commas. Example: 
        <ul>
          <li>The people present were Jamie, who came from New Zealand; John, the milkman's son; and George, a gaunt kind of man. 
            (Quoted from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon">Wikipedia: Semicolon</a>.)

    </p>

    <h3>Colon</h3>
    <p>The colon is used to illustrate, explain or elaborate the preceding sentence.</p>
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Code contributed to <abbr>GPII</abbr> should be made available under one of the following licences: 
        the Apache License 2.0, the <abbr>BSD</abbr> 3-Clause License or the <abbr>MIT</abbr> License.
      </li>
      <li>To install an extension in OpenOffice, proceed as follows: 
        open the Extension Manager in the Tools menu, click "Add&hellip;", browse to the folder where you downloaded the extension, 
        click "Open" and follow the instructions that appear during the installation process.
      </li>
      <li>The presentation is available in two formats: <abbr>ODF</abbr> and <abbr>PDF</abbr>.
      </li>
      <li>I had a rough weekend: I had chest pain and spent all Saturday and Sunday in the Emergency room. 
        (Quoted from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_%28punctuation%29#Usage">Wikipedia: Colon</a>.)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The colon is also used to introduce a longer quotation that is marked off from the rest of the text by indentation. Example:</p>
    <blockquote class="neutralquote">
      <p>As Samuel Johnson wrote:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Every man naturally persuades himself that he can keep his resolutions, 
        nor is he convinced of his imbecility but by length of time and frequency of experiment.</p>
      </blockquote>

    <h3>Long Dash</h3>
    <p>The hyphen (-) is not the appropriate punctuation mark for parenthetical remarks; use the long dash (—) instead.</p>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/--">Two successive hyphens</a> do not replace a long dash, 
      though some word processors may automatically replace the double hyphen with a long dash.

    <h2>Common Grammar Problems</h2>
    <h3>That, Which or Zero Relative Pronoun</h3>
    <p>That and which are relative pronouns, <abbr>i.e.</abbr> words that introduce a relative clause. 
      A relative clause is a type of subclause that provides additional information about a word or phrase (the "antecedent") in the main clause. 
      For example, in the sentence "The house that Jack built was large":
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>"The house was large" constitutes the main clause;</li>
      <li>"that jack built" is a relative clause;</li>
      <li>"The house" is the antecedent;</li>
      <li>"that" is the relative pronoun that refers back to the antecedent ("the house").</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Examples with <strong>that</strong> (with the subclause in italics):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>"that" is the subject of the subclause, so it cannot be omitted: 
        <ul>
          <li>The paper <i>that won the award</i> was highly influential in creating a new field of research.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>"that" is the object of the subclause, so it may be omitted:
        <ul>
          <li>The paper <i>(that) he presented at the <abbr>HCI</abbr> conference</i> describes a new usability evaluation method.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>"that" is the object of a preposition ("to") in the subclause and is usually omitted: 
        <ul>
          <li>The research <i>(that) she referred to</i> was new to me.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>"that" can be used to introduce a clause following a superlative, "the only", "all" <abbr>etc</abbr>:
        <ul>
          <li>Who was the greatest scientist <i>that ever lived</i>?</li>
          <li>This is the only paper <i>that provides a literature review of resistance to technology adoption by people with disabilities</i>.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>"that" can be used instead of "when" after an expression of time:
        <ul>
          <li>By the time <i>that/when the project ended</i>, the software had been downloaded 25,000 times.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <!-- Examples with 'which': @@TODO -->
    <p>Note: The choice between "that" and "which" is sometimes a

      (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_%28grammar%29#Indefinite_article">indefinite article</a>).
      The choice between the definite article, the indefinite article or the &ldquo;null article&rdquo; 
      (<abbr>i.e.</abbr> no article) depends on several things. 
      Below are a few basic rules. 
    </p>
    <p>&ldquo;<strong>The</strong>&rdquo; is used in the following situations: 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>before nouns that refer to something that is identifiable to the reader: 
        <ul>
          <li>The project started in 2012. (We assume that the reader knows which project, e.g. because it has been mentioned before.)</li>
          <li>The version we will user for testing is not ready yet. (The phrase "we will use for testing" makes the version identifiable.)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>before nouns that refer to something unique: 
        <ul>
          <li>The Moon is the only natural satellite of the Earth.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>before an adjective to refer to all members of a class or nationality: 
        <ul>
          <li>The expression &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squaring_the_circle">squaring the circle</a>&rdquo; 
            is sometimes used as a metaphor for trying to do <em>the impossible</em>.
          </li>
          <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_culture">The French</a> are often perceived as taking a great pride in national identity.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&ldquo;<strong>A/An</strong>&rdquo; is used in the following situations:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>before nouns that refer to something that is not identifiable to the reader:
        <ul>
          <li>Updating a screen reader can cost hundreds of euros.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> before nouns that refer to <em>any</em> member of a group: 
        <ul>
          <li>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader">screen reader</a> 
            is a software application that attempts to identify and interpret what is being displayed on the screen.

          </li>
          <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/node-inspector">node-inspector</a> requires a WebKit-based browser. (Any browser based on WebKit.)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>No article</strong> (or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-marking_in_English#Zero_article">zero article</a>) 
      is used in the following situations: 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>with generic nouns:
        <ul>
          <li>Accessibility is hard. 
            (Generic mass noun. Compare "The accessibility of OpenOffice has improved a lot", which is specific.)
          </li>
          <li>Screen readers are a form of assistive technology (<abbr>AT</abbr>) potentially useful to people who are blind, visually impaired, illiterate or learning disabled. 
            (Generic plural noun.)
          </li>
          <li>He designs and develops websites. (Indefinite plural noun.)</li>
          <li>I drink tea. (Indefinite mass noun.)</li>
          <li>The experimenter does not have information about the state of the

            (Quoted on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lies,_damned_lies,_and_statistics">Wikipedia</a>.)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>with many proper names: John, Spain, Lisbon <abbr>etc</abbr>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Prepositions</h3>
    <p>Examples of common errors:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>&ldquo;different <em>from</em>&rdquo; (not &ldquo;&hellip; to&rdquo;)</li>
      <li>&ldquo;independent <em>of</em>&rdquo; (not &ldquo;&hellip; from&rdquo;)</li>
      <li>&ldquo;used <em>by</em>&rdquo; (not &ldquo;&hellip; from&rdquo;)</li>
      <li>&ldquo;apply something <em>to</em> something&rdquo; (not &ldquo;at&rdquo;): 
        <abbr>e.g.</abbr> &ldquo;the settings are applied to the interface&rdquo;
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Apostrophes, Possessives and Contractions</h3>
    <p>Journal articles, project deliverables and other forms of formal writing should <strong>avoid contractions</strong> 
      such as "can't", "isn't", "it's, etcetera. Instead, write "cannot", "is not", "it is", respectively.
    </p>
    <p>Possessive forms are usually written with an apostrophe followed by an 's' (<kbd>'s</kbd>): </p>
    <ul>
      <li>after names: "Douglas Crockford's new book";</li>
      <li>after nouns <abbr>etc.</abbr>: "the participant's name", "this year's review", "everybody's acceptance tests", &hellip;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are a few special cases:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>names ending in an 's' that is pronounced: possessive form with <kbd>'s</kbd>: "James's car";</li>
      <li>names ending in an 's' that is non pronounced: possessive form with only an apostrophe: 
        "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method">Socrates' maeiutics</a>";
      </li>
      <li>plural nouns: possessive form with only an apostrophe: "both users' preferences", "two days' work".</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The following phrases have different meanings:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>"the user's participation" (the participation of one specific user) versus "the users' participation" (the participation of several users).</li>
      <li>"<strong>its</strong>" is a possessive pronoun (like "his" and "their") while "<strong>it's</strong>" is a contraction of "it is".</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For more details about possessives, see 
      <a href="http://www.sussex.ac.uk/informatics/punctuation/apostrophe/possessives">Larry Trask's Guide to Punctuation</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Singular They</h3>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they">Singular "they"</a> 
      is the use of "they" (and its inflected forms "them" and "their") to refer to a single person. 
      It is typically used to avoid constructions such as "he/she", "him/her" and "his/her", <abbr>i.e.</abbr> as a gender-neutral pronoun. 
    </p>
    <p>Even though "singular they" refers to a single person, the verb should still be conjugated in its normal (<abbr>i.e.</abbr> plural) form. Examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The user said that they <em>prefer</em> high contrast.</li>
      <li>When a user first sets up a preference set <em>they</em> can start by … 
        <br />(Instead of: &ldquo;When a user first sets up a preference set <em>he/she</em> can start by …&rdquo;.)
      </li>
      <li>A manufacturer fills out <em>their</em> product descriptions one at a time before <em>they</em> submit … 
        <br />(Instead of: &ldquo;A manufacturer fills out <em>his/her</em> product descriptions one at a time before <em>he/she</em> submits …&rdquo;.)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: hen referring to a person of known sex, it is advisable to use the singular pronoun. For example: 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>No <em>mother</em> should be forced to testify against <em>her</em> child.</li>
      <li><em>John</em> updates <em>his</em> preferences using the preferences editor.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Adjectives and Adverbs</h3>
    <p>In general, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverb">adverbs</a> 
      can be formed by adding <em>-ly</em> to 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjective">adjectives</a>.
      <br />Examples:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>slow: to drive slowly.</li>
      <li>incredible: incredibly boring.</li>
      <li>&ldquo;This is a <i>kind</i> reminder to fill in the Doodle poll.&rdquo; (adjective) 
        versus 
        &ldquo;May I <i>kindly</i> remind you to fill in the Doodle poll?&rdquo; (adverb).</li>
      <li>&ldquo;a brief presentation&rdquo; (adjective) 
        versus 
        &ldquo;briefly present the project&rdquo; (adverb).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>There are a few exceptions to the above adverb formation rule:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Some adjectives cannot be turned into adverbs by adding <em>-ly</em>, for example, big, fast. 
        <br />For example: "Drive fast, see our judge" (from a funny traffic sign<!--http://www.funnysigns.net/drive-slow-drive-fast/ bad gateway, 28.11.2019-->).
      </li>
      <li>Some adjectives cannot be turned into adverbs by adding <em>-ly</em> without a change in meaning. 
        <ul>
          <li>The primary meaning of <a href="http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/hardly">hardly</a> is "scarcely, barely". 
            (So the expression "I have hardly worked" has a different meaning than "I have worked very hard".)
          </li>
          <li>The primary meaning of <a href="http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/shortly">shortly</a> is "soon". 
            When you want to say something in a few words, you can use the adverb "briefly".
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

        &ldquo;Before the accident, Jane was an active social network member, like any other person of her age.&rdquo;
      </li>
    </ul>
    -->
    <h3>Conjunctions versus -ing Forms</h3>
    <p><!-- In project deliverables: -->Too many sentences connect a main clause with a subclause by means of an <em>-ing</em> form. Conjunctions express these connections better.</p>
    <p>Examples from project deliverables:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><q>This is a very interesting application scenario, <em>highlighting</em> the need to address contextual aspects in the applicability of user N&amp;Ps.</q>
        <br />The relationship between the main clause and the subclause can be made explicit by rephrasing it as follows:
        <br />&ldquo;This is a very interesting application scenario, <em>because it highlights</em>&hellip;&rdquo;
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Sentence Length</h3>
    <p>Sentences are not sausages in which you can stuff as many words as you want.
      Non-native speakers of English can considerably improve their writing by creating shorter sentences. 
    </p>
    <p>Examples from project deliverables:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><q>Joad is 68-year old and one of his hobbies is walking through the paths around the mountains nearby the city area where he lives.</q>
        <br />Proposed rewording:
        <br />&ldquo;Joad is 68 years old. One of his hobbies is &hellip;&rdquo;

    <h3>Register and Bloated Language</h3>
    <p>Some words in project deliverables and papers have a different connotation than the author intended. 
      For example, some researchers use <strong>legal English</strong> when more readable alternatives exist:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>hereinafter</em>: &ldquo;after this&rdquo;;</li>
      <li><em>aforesaid</em> (usage: &ldquo;the aforesaid x&rdquo;) and
        <em>aforementioned</em>: &ldquo;mentioned earlier&rdquo;, &ldquo;referred to earlier&rdquo; (usage: &ldquo;the x mentioned earlier&rdquo;).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some words in deliverables are chosen because they are longer, sound smarter or more &ldquo;impressive&rdquo; but make the text harder to read. 
      For example:

    <ul>
      <li>the verb <em>utilise/utilize</em> 
        <a href="http://users.wpi.edu/~nab/sci_eng/99_Apr_22.html">sounds bureaucratic and is overused</a>; 
        write <em>use</em> instead, unless you want to emphasise that you

    <h3>Nominalisation</h3>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominalization">Nominalisation</a> 
      is the use of an adjective, verb or adverb as if it were a noun. 
      For example: &ldquo;You cannot <em>change</em> the user interface language&rdquo; (verb) versus &ldquo;There was no <em>change</em>&rdquo; (noun). 
    </p>
    <p>Many languages allow the nominalisation of adjectives and 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uses_of_English_verb_forms#Past_participle">past participles</a> in order to refer to persons. 
      For example, &ldquo;deceased&rdquo; can be used in the phrase &ldquo;the deceased&rdquo; (persons or persons who have recently died). 
      However, which adjectives and past participles can be used in this way varies between languages, 
      so you sometimes need alternative formulations when translating into English. 
    </p>
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Write &ldquo;the person(s) in charge of &hellip;&rdquo;, &ldquo;leader&rdquo; or &ldquo;person responsible for&rdquo;
        instead of &ldquo;the responsibles&rdquo;.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Nominalisations such as &ldquo;the blind&rdquo;, &ldquo;the poor&rdquo; and &ldquo;the unemployed&rdquo; refer to a category of people and take a verb in the plural form. 
      For example: &ldquo;The blind have access to less than 5% of printed material in most parts of the world.&rdquo; <!-- @@source of quote? -->

    <p>British, American, Canadian and other varieties of English don't always use the same word to the same concept. 
      In addition, the same word can have different meanings in different English-speaking countries.
    </p>
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Both caretaker (<abbr>UK</abbr>) and caregiver (<abbr>USA</abbr> and Canada) can mean carer.</li>

    <h3>Active Versus Passive Voice</h3>
    <p>The <a href="http://asa.aip.org/honolulu/honolulu.html#34">INSTRUCTIONS 
      FOR THE PREPARATION OF PAPER-COPY ABSTRACTS FOR PAPERS TO BE PRESENTED AT MEETINGS OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA</a> (2006)
      even required the passive for certain types of statements:
      <q>7. Use passives instead of pronouns "I" and "we," <abbr>e.g.</abbr>, 
        "It was noted" instead of "We noted." Avoid use of non-standard abbreviations in abstract title. 
        For example, use <abbr>dB</abbr> or <abbr>Hz</abbr> but avoid use of abbreviations which are not used 
        across many technical areas such as <abbr>HRTF</abbr>, <abbr>NDE</abbr>, <abbr>etc</abbr>.</q>

          It focuses on the issues confronting non-native-English-speaking academics, scholars and students, 
          who face increasing pressure to write and publish in English, now widely acknowledged as the academic lingua franca. 
          Questions of identity, access, pedagogy and empowerment naturally arise.

      (<abbr>e.g.</abbr> on difference between certain synonyms and near synonyms, <abbr>e.g.</abbr> "change", "alter" and "modify"), 
      full sentence examples and examples of prepositions that can be used with the noun or verb you are looking up.
