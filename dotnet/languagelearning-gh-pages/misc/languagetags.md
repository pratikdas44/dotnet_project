# ISO Language Tags

ISO language tags (ISO 639-1, else ISO 639-3) for languages, with English name and endonym.
the languages are ordered by number of speakers according to the list in the
[Wikipedia article 'List of languages by number of native speakers'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_number_of_native_speakers).

## Notes

Endonyms are based on entries in the English version of Wikipedia. 
Where capitalisation is relevant, the endonym is capitalised.
Where several endonyms are available or where the endonym is also used in Wikipedia's 
[interlanguage links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Interlanguage_links),
the endonym used in the interlanguage links is given precedence.

Some languages miss translations/endonyms because the script used by the language could not be copied from Wikipedia (typically due to rendering issues of the script in the browser):

* `jv` (Javanese: writing system cannot be rendered in browser),
* `my` (Burmese: writing system cannot be rendered in browser),
* `dhd``(Dhundari: writing system not mentioned on Wikipedia),
* `kok` (Konkani: कोंकणी is a partial guess).

For languages that have more than one ISO 639-3 tag, only one tag is given. For example:

* [Hmong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hmong_language): `hmv` (not listed: `mww`, `hnj`, `hmz`, etc.).

To do:
* Add remaining langauges with ISO 639-1 code from [List of ISO 639-1 codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes).
* Then add languages with an ISO 639-3 code but no ISO 639-1 code from [List of ISO 639-3 codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-3_codes).
