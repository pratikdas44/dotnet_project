  <main id="main">
    <p>Stack Exchange is a network of
      of question &amp; answer sites about specific topics. 
      People can ask questions or answer other people's questions.
      Both questions and answers can received upvotes and downvotes. 
      Upvotes on answers bring the &ldquo;best&rdquo; answers to the top.
      There are several Stack Exchange sites related to language.
    </p>
    <p>Anyone can propose a new Stack Exchange site. 
      The proposal will then go through several phases before the site can
      &ldquo;graduate&rdquo;: definition (which is mainly about which types of
      questions would be allowed), commit, and public beta.
      A beta site needs to acquire a specific critical mass (in users,
      daily visitors, number of questions per day, number of answers per question)
      before it can graduate.
      (On 1 August 2019, all beta sites that had been around for seven years or longer were moved from &ldquo;beta&rdquo; to &ldquo;launched&rdquo;.)
    </p>

    <h2>&ldquo;Horizontal&rdquo; Sites</h2>

    <p>The first two sites are &ldquo;horizontal&rdquo; in the sense that they 
      are not about a specific language but focus on a specific aspect that applies
      across languages:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/">Linguistics</a><!--graduated on 01.08.2019-->:
        <q>a question and answer site for professional linguists and others with an interest in linguistic research and theory</q>.
      </li>
      <li><a href="http://languagelearning.stackexchange.com/">Language Learning</a> (beta):
        <q>a question and answer site for students, teachers, polyglots, and anyone interested in the techniques of second-language acquisition</q>.
        (In spite of the description, the site is also accepts questions about first-language acquisition.)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="languages">Language-Specific Sites</h2>
    <p>Most language-related sites focus on a specific language.
      (Sites that have graduated are listed first. The beta sites are listed in alphabetical order.)
    </p>
    <ul>

        had been proposed in July 2016 and went into beta in early February 2018.
        <!--(An <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/89262/constructed-languages">earlier attempt</a> had failed).-->
      </li>
      </li>
      <li><a href="https://esperanto.stackexchange.com/">Esperanto</a> (public beta since August 2016):

        The site went public at the end of February 2017.

        was originally proposed in December 2015.)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p id="area51">Finally, new proposals are continually being submitted. 
      The following proposed sites are still on 
      <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/categories/3/culture">Area 51</a>, 
      Stack Exchange's staging area.
      In April 2018, Stack Exchange 
      <a href="https://area51.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/27938/changes-to-the-area-51-process-v3-0">changed the rules for Area 51</a>
      because there had been too many weak site proposals.
      (Note: this list was created in early October 2016 and can go quickly out of date,
      as new proposals get submitted and proposals that are not viable get deleted.)
